Create a Project

Accessing the CloudNeo App
---------------------------------
After creating the account and the project, please contact the author `Dr. Chuang <Jeff.Chuang@jax.org>`_ for access to the CloudNeo app. There are two ways we could provide access to the app:

* You can add one of the authors as a temporary team member to your project. The team member would then copy the app to the project.
* We could also add you as a temporary member to one of our projects. You will be able to access and copy the app to your own project.

.. seealso::  More information on `adding a member <http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/add-a-collaborator>`_
 to the project.
