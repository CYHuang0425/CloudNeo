Create a Project
--------------------------------------------
Login to the account and create a `project <http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/projects-on-the-platform>`_ to do your analysis. Projects act as a container to store your data, apps, workflows. You can create a project by clicking on 'Create a Project' button, as highlighted in the below screenshot.

 is `available here <http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/create-a-project>`_.

Accessing the CloudNeo App
---------------------------------
After creating the account and the project, please contact the author `Dr. Chuang <Jeff.Chuang@jax.org>`_ for access to the CloudNeo app. Workflows and Tools are called `Apps <http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/public-apps>`_ on Seven Bridges CGC platfrom. There are two ways we could provide access to the app:

* You can add one of the authors as a temporary team member to your project. The team member would then copy the app to the project.
* We could also add you as a temporary member to one of our projects. You will be able to access and copy the app to your own project.

.. seealso::  More information on `adding a member <http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/add-a-collaborator>`_
 to the project.

Running the CloudNeo App

Select input files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Add the files that you would like to analyze to the project. The files must be in the project to select it as input. All the inputs are required for the CloudNeo app.
