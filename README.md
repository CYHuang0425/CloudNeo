# CloudNeo Workflow Overview

## Overview

This repository has the [CWL](http://www.commonwl.org/) implementation of CloudNeo: A cloud pipeline for identifying patient-specific tumor neoantigen.
The workflow was developed on Seven Bridges Genomics' CGC platfrom. The CGC went live in Nov 2015 when the CWL spec was still in Draft 2. There are differences between the `draft-2` and the version `v.1.0`.
