# CloudNeo Workflow Overview

## Overview

This repository has the [CWL](http://www.commonwl.org/) implementation of CloudNeo: A cloud pipeline for identifying patient-specific tumor neoantigen.
The workflow was developed on Seven Bridges Genomics' CGC platfrom in CWL- Draft2 version. The CGC went live in Nov 2015 when the CWL specifications were still in Draft 2. There are differences between the `draft-2` and the version `v.1.0` but CGC is still in CWl-Draft2 version as of March 2017.
